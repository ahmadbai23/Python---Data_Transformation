# PythonTransformation

The Python code below demonstrates how to transform data from a large CSV format into spatial data, specifically a geodatabase (ESRI), by specifying appropriate data types for the values to prevent data changes that alter the values.

The first step is to clone the Python environment from ArcGIS. To perform data transformation directly into a geodatabase in ArcGIS, we need to clone the environment first because we require a module called arcpy to perform various functions, such as creating tables in the ArcGIS geodatabase or inserting data into ArcGIS. You can explore further on how to clone the environment independently. (Note: Cloning the environment is necessary because the original ArcGIS environment cannot be used for manipulation.)

Once you have cloned the ArcGIS environment, make sure to run the code within that cloned environment. The explanation of the code is provided within the code file. Here, I'll add some crucial information:
1. Ensure that you create an empty geodatabase beforehand because the code only specifies the directory of the geodatabase; there is no code for creating the geodatabase itself.
2. Make sure that the field type and field name in the dictionary in the code match the field names in your CSV file (you can explore field types in ArcGIS independently).

After following the steps above, you should be able to successfully transform data from a CSV into a geodatabase.

To practice, I will attach a dummy dataset (TESTING_DATA.csv) with 100 rows, focusing on transforming the data in the "UNIQUE_ID" column.

Good luck with your endeavor!
